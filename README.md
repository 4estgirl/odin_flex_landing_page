# odin_flex_landing_page

The goal of this assignment is to make a landing page that looks something like this: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png

I am supposed to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and specifically flexbox to create this, but am otherwise not given much for guidelines.
